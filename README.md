## App Description

+ This application is an exercise that implements a queue data structure to simulate a live pet adoption process. The user may join the queue and see other 'fake' adoptees in queue as well.

+ Homepage
  + Here you will find a description of the application and the instructions for use of its features.
  + The user may preview the adoption process without joining a queue by clicking the preview adoptions button
  + The user may enter their name in the text input and click the join queue button to enter the adoption queue and route to the Adopt page.

+ Adopt Page
  + If a user chooses to only preview the adoption process, they will see the pets queued up and adopted by the 'fake' adoptees in the adoption line. The adopt buttons are disabled.
  + If a user enters their name, they are entered into the adoption line queue with the other 'fake' adoptees. Once the user reaches the front of the line, the adopt now button is enabled and they may choose a bet.
  + All users are congratulated below on their adoptions.
  + The User may click on the Petful link at the top of the app to return to the Homepage at any time.
